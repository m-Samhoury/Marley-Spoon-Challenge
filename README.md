# Marley Spoon mini app

#### This sample was created to showcase my skills and the latest learnings in the Android Framework.

For this client app I used contentful SDK to be able consume the APIs from contentful

Used Coil-kt for image loading

Used Navigation component to provide the navigation in the app

Kotlin-coroutines were used for blocking operations(fetching recipes list from the server)

Used LiveData and ViewModels as well

Koin was used to glue the different components together in the application


Here is a gif demonstrating this super mini app
